# Contribution Guidelines

> Please be aware that we want to accept your contribution, but we have **some rules to keep the minimum quality** 
of the packages listed here. All reviews are **not personal feedback**, 
even if you are a _developer reviewing your contribution_. **Sorry if we can't meet your expectations, we do our best**.

- **To add, remove, or change things on the list:** Submit a pull request

Please contribute links to packages/projects you have used or are familiar with. This will help ensure high-quality entries.

## Quality Standards
To be on the list , github repositories must follow certain conditions

- have an **open source license**, [see list of allowed licenses](https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical);
- function as documented and expected;
- be generally useful to the wider community of Go programmers;
- be actively maintained with:
  - regular, recent commits;
  - or, for finished projects, issues and pull requests are responded to generally within 2 weeks;
- be stable or progressing toward stable;
- be thoroughly documented (README, doc comments, etc.) in the english language, so everyone is able to understand the project's intention and how it works.

## How to add item to the list

Open a pull request against the README.md document that adds the repository to the list.


- The pull request should add one and only one item to the list.
- The added item should be in alphabetical order within its category.
- The link should be the name of the package or project.
- Descriptions should be clear, concise, and non-promotional.
- Descriptions should follow the link, on the same line and end with a punctuation mark.
- Remember to put a period `.` at end of the project description.

If you are creating a new category, move the projects that apply to the new category, ensuring
that the resulting list has at least 3 projects in every category and that the categories are alphabetized.
